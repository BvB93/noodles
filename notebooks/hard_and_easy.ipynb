    "Often in computation, a program is a mix of easy and hard problems. Some jobs only take a fraction of a second, others hours on end. It may be beneficial to mix these in a way that the hard jobs are outsourced to a compute node, while we don't want to spend minutes or even days waiting in the queue to do something very simple."
